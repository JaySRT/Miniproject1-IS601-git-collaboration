## How the usage of some _**Developer Tools**_ can improve the _**productivity & competitiveness**_ of a company

One important factor to increase efficiency and productivity in software development is to be familiar with essential tools. Git is one of the tools that is necessary to track and maintain code specially on team work. Git provide the hundreds of comments and configuration which every developer might face in day to day work life.

Knowing your everyday tool set increases your productivity as a developer. And **Git** is one of those tools you use on a daily basis. Mastering Git is tough; it has hundreds of different commands, often even inconsistent at how you pass in flags and configuration options. On the other side, there are a lot of good Git courses out there already, explaining all of these commands in detail. These are in breif for only day to day productivity than go through whole commands:

* Git flow and repository
* Using git "Status" and "log" to track the local changes
* Transfer git commit from one branch to another
* Configure git config to display readable logs
* Undoing accidental commits

**Docker containers** provide a way to get a grip on software. You can use Docker to wrap up an application in such a way that its deployment and runtime issues—how to expose it on a network, how to manage its use of storage and memory and I/O, how to control access permissions—are handled outside of the application itself, and in a way that is consistent across all “containerized” apps. You can run your Docker container on any OS-compatible host (Linux or Windows) that has the Docker runtime installed.

**Automated Testing**

Every software development group tests its products, yet delivered software always has defects. Test engineers strive to catch them before the product is released but they always creep in and they often reappear, even with the best manual testing processes. Test Automation software is the best way to increase the effectiveness, efficiency and coverage of your software testing.

An automated testing tool is able to playback pre-recorded and predefined actions, compare the results to the expected behavior and report the success or failure of these manual tests to a test engineer. Once automated tests are created they can easily be repeated and they can be extended to perform tasks impossible with manual testing. Because of this, savvy managers have found that automated software testing is an essential component of successful development projects.

**Continuous integration**

Continuous integration (CI) is the software development practice of regularly integrating code changes into a shared code repository. Typically, this would happen at least once or then several times a day (depending on the number of code commits) and this practice encourages committing small changes more often over committing large changes infrequently. Each commit triggers a build during which tests are run that help to identify if anything was broken by the changes.
