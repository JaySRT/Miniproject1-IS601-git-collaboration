# Commit:
Git commit saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit functions like taking a photo. Anything that’s been staged with git add will become a part of the snapshot with git commit. It will save any changes to the local repository.

There are also options when using a git commit command. Adding a -m will allow user to input a message, or description of the changes. A -a will include all current changed files in the commit. A –amend will allow for the rewrite of the last commit.

### Example:

git commit -m "message"
