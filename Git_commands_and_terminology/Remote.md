# Remote Add / Remove / Show:

The git remote command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. Remote connections are more like bookmarks rather than direct links into other repositories. Instead of providing real-time access to another repository, they serve as convenient names that can be used to reference a not-so-convenient URL.

The git remote command is essentially an interface for managing a list of remote entries that are stored in the repository's ./.git/config file.

### Remote Add:
To add a new remote, use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored at. The git remote add command takes two arguments: A unique remote name, for example, “my_awesome_new_remote_repo” or a remote URL, which you can find on the Source sub-tab of your Git repo.

### Remote Remove:
Using the command, git remove rm will remove a remote URL from the git repository.

### Remote Show:
To view the list of your remotes, use the git remote command and it will list the short names of each remote handle you’ve specified.
