# Status:

The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. It will show you any difference in the current tree and the HEAD pointer. Along with this Git status will also show you the changed or new file in the repository. Status output does not show you any information regarding the committed project history.
